      <p>NeuralMarket is an ultra-low latency market making bot that provides liquidity across multiple asset classes including equities, futures, and cryptocurrencies. Using advanced reinforcement learning and game theory, the system optimally places bid-ask spreads to capture the spread while managing inventory risk.</p>
      
      <p>The bot employs sophisticated order book analysis, predicting short-term price movements and order flow imbalances to adjust quotes dynamically. It uses deep Q-learning to optimize quote placement and inventory management in real-time.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Advanced Features:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Microsecond-level order placement and cancellation</li>
        <li>Adaptive spread optimization based on volatility and volume</li>
        <li>Inventory risk management with dynamic hedging</li>
        <li>Adverse selection detection and mitigation</li>
        <li>Order flow toxicity analysis</li>
        <li>Multi-venue market making with smart routing</li>
        <li>Latency arbitrage detection and exploitation</li>
        <li>Maker-taker fee optimization</li>
      </ul>
